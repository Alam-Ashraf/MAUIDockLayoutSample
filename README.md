In this article, I’m going to show you how to use DockLayout in MAUI Community Toolkit.

The Xamarin.CommunityToolkit DockLayout in MAUI is a layout where children can be docked to the sides of the layout container.

Children are docked at one of 4 possible docking positions : Top, Bottom, Left or Right.

Child that are not explicitly docked or (with ‘None‘) are displayed at the center.
